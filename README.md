Project Title: Sonar Dataset Classification for Mine and Rock Detection

Objective: 
To predict whether an object is a mine or a rock using sonar signals, which is crucial for submarine navigation in war scenarios to avoid underwater mines planted by the enemy.

Story:
In a wartime scenario, a country's submarine needs to navigate underwater while avoiding mines planted by the enemy. To safely travel, it must distinguish between rocks and mines using sonar technology. The sonar system emits sound waves that bounce back upon hitting objects, and the collected data from these reflections can be used to differentiate between mines and rocks.

To simulate this, data was collected by setting up a controlled environment with rocks and metallic cylinders acting as dummy mines. Sound waves were emitted towards these objects, and the reflected signals were recorded for analysis. The goal was to use machine learning techniques to predict whether an object is a mine or a rock based on the collected sonar data.



Technology:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools:
                     Pandas for data manipulation
                     NumPy for numerical computations
                     Scikit-learn for machine learning
                     Logistic Regression model
                     Train-Test Split for model validation

Impact: 
The project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in defense scenarios, enhancing submarine safety by accurately predicting and distinguishing between mines and rocks. This prediction can help submarines navigate more safely and reduce the risk of mine-related explosions during underwater missions.

Process:
1) Data Collection:
Simulated sonar data was collected by emitting sound waves at rocks and metallic cylinders.

2) Data Preprocessing:
Imported necessary dependencies and loaded the dataset.
Analyzed the dataset using functions like shape, describe(), value_counts(), and groupby().
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Performed statistical analysis, calculating measures like mean and median.

3) Model Development:
Separated the dataset into dependent and independent variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets using the Train-Test Split method.
Developed a Logistic Regression model to classify the data.

4) Result:
Achieved an accuracy score of 82% in predicting whether an object is a mine or a rock.
